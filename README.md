# mqsrv-insurgency-sourcemod

A source code repository of sourcemod plugins, which can be used for game insurgency.

So why did I create this repository:  I closed my server few month ago, but the code of some plugins on my server are opensource. Base on their licences, I have to release them; for another, many senior sourcemod coder from sourcemod community, steamÂ discussions, discord and github help me a lot with programming. Although I'm not good at coding at all,   but I still hope this repository can help more sourcemod novices or server owners like me.

Some of my code and GPLv2 sourcecode from other authors I was modified will be released in this repository, only GPLv2. If it helps you, please give a star for me or support original author.

(There may be ambiguity or difficult to understand what's mean in README, excuse my poor English ...)

Attention: most of plugins in this repository can only work in insurgency2 cooperative mode normally.
